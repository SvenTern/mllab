Areas of Contribution
#####################

Currently we have a live project board that follows the principles of Agile Project Management.

At the time of writing, we are focusing our attentions primarily on those contributions by the current Researchers enrolled
in our `Apprenticeship Program <https://hudsonthames.org/apprenticeship-program/>`_.

There is of course room for the public to make contributions. The most useful are those that help to improve user experience.
Good examples of this is writing tutorial notebooks which answer questions
from the back of a chapter, mlfinlab recipes, improving docstrings, and adding new sphinx documentation.

Raising Issues
##############

We have created `templates`_ to help aid in creating issues and PRs:

Please do create issues for new feature requests and bug fixes.
