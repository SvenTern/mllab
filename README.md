## What is MlFinLab?
MlFinlab python library is a perfect toolbox that every financial machine learning researcher needs. 

It covers every step of the ML strategy creation, starting from data structures generation and finishing with backtest statistics.
We pride ourselves in the robustness of our codebase - every line of code existing in the modules is extensively tested and 
documented.


## Documentation, Example Notebooks and Lecture Videos
For every technique present in the library we not only provide extensive documentation, with both theoretical explanations
and detailed descriptions of available functions, but also supplement the modules with ever-growing array of lecture videos and slides 
on the implemented methods.
 
We want you to be able to use the tools right away. To achieve that, every module comes with a number of example notebooks 
which include detailed examples of the usage of the algorithms. Our goal is to show you the whole pipeline, starting from 
importing the libraries and ending with strategy performance metrics so you can get the added value from the get-go.
